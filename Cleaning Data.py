# # Data_for_Dating_site Task 1: Is there a correlation between user's location (rural or urban) and their age?
# ### Once we have our data, we need to determine the necessary one and in this case it is the  correlation between location and their age.

# Necessary data is determined by:
# 1. First we need to determine what data could disaprove our hypothesis (for instance, age affects dating patterns)
# 2. Second, we find out how much data to collect. Whole population is ideal but impractical so we need to choose a sample set of data.
# According to the Sample size calculator online, information like margin of error (in my case 5% as larger the error, the less confidence we should have), confidence level (95%), population size and Likely sample proportion (50%)
