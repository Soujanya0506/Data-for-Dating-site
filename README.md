# Data-for-Dating-site

This is a task done as a part of Introduction to Data science course on Codeacademy. The plan is to find insights and trends that affect the user behavior using this site.
The datasets used will be users_data and pop_data.

Our plan will be to analyse about how factors like age, location, education, job and income affect the dating pattern.
Next, we need to figure out how much data to collect.
How do we ensure that our sample is representative? We figure out the necessary number of samples that have similar descriptive statistics to the entire population.
